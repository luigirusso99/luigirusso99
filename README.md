- 👋 Hi, I am Luigi Russo
- 👀 I am working in Artificial Intelligence (AI) applied to Earth Observation (AI4EO).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about remote sensing and AI techniques for satellite data analysis.
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to remote sensing, AI for Earth observation, satellite data processing, and automatic mapping of exposure and vulnerability from built-up areas.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can contact me via email at [luigi.russo1@gmail.com](mailto:your.email@example.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn]([https://www.linkedin.com/in/luigi-russo-048146284/]).

### About Me

I am a Student Member of IEEE and earned my master’s degree (cum laude) in Electronic Engineering for Automation and Telecommunications from the University of Sannio, Benevento, Italy, in 2023. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. at the University of Pavia in collaboration with the Italian Space Agency (ASI) in Rome. My research focuses on remote sensing and artificial intelligence for the automatic classification and analysis of satellite data, with a particular emphasis on creating maps of building exposure and vulnerability to natural hazards and extreme events.
